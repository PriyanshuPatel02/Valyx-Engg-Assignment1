## Task 1
At any point of time, a business is interested in figuring how much they are spending on a
particular category like salary, infrastructure, marketing etc. At the same time they might be
also interested in looking at categories where they are earning money from e.g. online sales
etc. This data can be fetched using line item descriptions in bank account statements.
However a business might be maintaining multiple accounts and we will have to search
across statements to get a clear picture of things.
Your task is, given a bunch of bank account statements, build a tool where the user can -
● Search by keywords across bank account statements. For example - A user can
search by “salary” and all the line items containing salary should be displayed to the
user.
● Select a list of bank accounts across which the user wants to search.
● Select a time range across which the search is to be done.
Feel free to use any tools that might help you and any database that will help in doing these
kinds of queries. However, please provide an explanation of why you chose to use them.

## Task 2
The users might be interested in how certain expenses/income are trending over time and
what are their aggregated values. As a result we want to develop a tool where users can
input certain categories and see the spends or earnings on those categories both
aggregated and over time.
For simplicity, you can assume that a category is a keyword (like “salary”) and if a line item
contains that keyword it falls under that category.
For this task it is up to you to design how you want to present this data to the user and build
it accordingly.
