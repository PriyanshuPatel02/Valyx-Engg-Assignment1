Python: Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language with a rich ecosystem of libraries and packages. It is a popular choice for data analysis and visualization because of its simplicity and readability.

Pandas: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It is chosen for several reasons:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Pandas simplifies the process of loading CSV data into dataframes and provides tools for preprocessing and cleaning the data, such as converting date columns to datetime objects.

Data Filtering and Categorization: Pandas allows for efficient data filtering based on conditions, which is essential for categorizing expenses and earnings based on keywords.

Data Aggregation: Pandas provides functions for calculating aggregates like total expenses and earnings, which is necessary for the tool's functionality.

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a widely-used library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is chosen for its capabilities in creating time series plots:

Time Series Visualization: Matplotlib is well-suited for visualizing time series data, such as how expenses or earnings evolve over time. It allows for the creation of line plots that show trends over specified time periods.

Customization: Matplotlib provides extensive customization options for plots, allowing the code to create informative and visually appealing time series graphs for each category.

datetime: The datetime library is used for parsing and handling date and time information in the bank account statement data. It is essential for filtering data based on the user-defined time range.

These libraries were chosen because they provide a comprehensive set of tools for data manipulation, filtering, aggregation, and visualization, all of which are essential for building a tool to analyze and visualize bank account statement data effectively.
